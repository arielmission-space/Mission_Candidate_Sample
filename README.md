# Mission_Candidate_Sample
Repository for the Ariel Mission Candidate Sample.

Target lists derived from the currently known exoplanets and the TESS Planet Candidates (TPCs) are provided in the target_list folder. In general, it is advisable to use the most recent MCS in each case.

If you use this data in a publication, please reference Edwards & Tinetti 2022 (https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022AJ....164...15E/abstract).

If you are feeling particularly generous, you could also cite the previous target list paper (Edwards et al. 2019, https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019AJ....157..242E/abstract), in which much of the current target list methodology is described, and the paper describing ArielRad (Mugnai et al. 2020, https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ExA....50..303M/abstract), which was used to model the perfomance of Ariel when developing these lists.
